      <h2 id="headline">PewDiePie's Youtube career short brief history</h2>
      <div class="menu-article">
        <h3 class="font-title">1957</h3>
        <p>PewDiePie was born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden. He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (née Hellstrand,
          born 7 May 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 8 January 1957), and grew up with his sister. His mother,
          a former CIO, was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden. His father is also a corporate executive.</p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2006</h3>
        <p>PewDiePie originally registered a YouTube account under the name "Pewdie" in 2006; he explained that "pew"
          represents the sound of lasers and "die" means death.</p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2010</h3>
        <p>After forgetting the password to this account, during his time at the university, he registered a new
          YouTube account under the name PewDiePie on YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. </p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2011</h3>
        <p>PewDiePie originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers
          University of Technology in Gothenburg. he dropped out of Chalmers after losing interest in his degree field,
          much to the dismay of his parents.
          PewDiePie focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games. Some
          of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including Minecraft and Call of Duty,
          although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of Amnesia: The Dark Descent and its related mods.
          PewDiePie also began posting weekly vlogs under the title of Fridays with PewDiePie.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2012</h3>
        <p>After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus
          on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of
          his Photoshop art projects and worked at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online
          following, On 9 May 2012, PewDiePie's channel reached 500,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel
          earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012, and in July 2012, his channel
          surpassed one million subscribers.</p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2013</h3>
        <p>On 18 February 2013, the PewDiePie channel reached 5 million subscribers, and in April, PewDiePie was
          covered in The New York Times after surpassing 6 million subscribers. In May, at the inaugural Starcount
          Social Stars Awards in Singapore PewDiePie won the award for "Swedish Social Star". Competing against
          Jenna Marbles, Smosh and Toby Turner, PewDiePie also won the award for "Most Popular Social Show". In
          July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most-subscribed YouTube user, and reached 10
          million subscribers on 9 July 2013.
          On 15 August 2013, PewDiePie became the most-subscribed user on YouTube, being briefly surpassed in late 2013
          by YouTube Spotlight. PewDiePie received a certificate from Guinness World Records for becoming the most
          subscribed YouTuber.</p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2014</h3>
        <p>In 2014 alone, PewDiePie's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and over 4.1 billion video
          views; both figures were higher than any other user. According to SocialBlade, a website which tracks
          YouTube channel statistics, on 29 December 2014, the PewDiePie channel surpassed emimusic's video view count,
          at over 7.2 billion views, to become the most-viewed channel on the website.
          To this point, PewDiePie's commentaries were best known for featuring horror video games. In 2014, however,
          he began to more actively play games that interested him, regardless of genre.
          In March 2014, PewDiePie made an estimated $140,000-$1.4 million monthly from YouTube revenue, according to
          SocialBlade. In June 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that PewDiePie earned $4 million in 2013.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2015</h3>
        <p>During July 2015, PewDiePie's videos were documented to receive over 300 million views per month. On 6
          September, PewDiePie's YouTube account became the first to eclipse 10 billion video views.
          During September 2015, PewDiePie teased about having a role in a series, stating that he was in Los Angeles
          for the show's shooting. Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced
          that the series would be titled Scare PewDiePie.[103] The series premiered the following February.
          PewDiePie appeared at the top of Forbes' October 2015 list of the richest YouTube stars with a reported $12
          million earned in 2015.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2016</h3>
        <p>In 2016, Time named him one of "The World's 100 Most Influential People". PewDiePie lives in Brighton
          with his fiancée, Italian Internet personality and fashion designer Marzia Bisognin.
          Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change became more apparent than the tweaks he implemented in the
          past. While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his
          style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, "I think the thing is that I have
          a lot of younger audience [members], and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it."
          On 8 December, PewDiePie's channel reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do
          so. After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted "will delete tomorrow 5 pm gmt," in reference to his
          channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete
          his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating "You know when you
          make a joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" PewDiePie's stunt received negative
          reception from Fortune.
          On 18 December 2016, he received a custom Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million
          subscribers.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2017</h3>
        <p>By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 of which have been made
          private.
          On 14 February 2017, his channel's total video view count was surpassed by Indian record label T-Series at
          the top of YouTube's view rankings, according to SocialBlade.
          In January 2017, PewDiePie began to receive criticism for his non-gaming videos. According to International
          Business Times, one of the videos "appeared to show" him using the racial slur "nigger", which caused
          #PewdiepieIsOverParty to trend worldwide on Twitter.
          A few days later, PewDiePie created further controversy, when he uploaded a video featuring him reviewing the
          website Fiverr, which allows people to sell a service for US$5. In the video, PewDiePie shows his reaction to
          a duo he had paid to display the message "DEATH TO ALL JEWS" on a sign.
          On 13 February, the Disney-owned Maker Studios multi-channel network cut its ties with PewDiePie because of
          the aforementioned controversy and the additional videos containing allegedly anti-Semitic jokes.
          Google also took action, dropping him from the Google Preferred advertising programme, as well as cancelling
          the Scare PewDiePie YouTube Red series.
          In September 2017, PewDiePie drew criticism again when he used the racial slur "nigger" during an outburst at
          another player while live-streaming PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.
          As a response to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to PewDiePie as "worse than a
          closeted racist", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against PewDiePie's videos
          featuring the studio's game Firewatch, and encouraged other game developers to do the same.
          PewDiePie later uploaded a short video apologizing for the language he used during the live-stream,
          expressing "I'm not going to make any excuses to why [the slur] did [slip out] because there are no excuses
          for it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="font-title">2018 - Present</h3>
        <p>The prevailing nickname used by media outlets for PewDiePie's fanbase is the "Bro Army", although this
          changed to "Squad Fam" before he began to refer to his subscribers as "nine-year-olds" in 2018
          In 2018, Paul MacInnes of The Guardian wrote about PewDiePie's YouTube content; he noted that each week
          PewDiePie posted videos featuring one of three series formats, comparing this uploading pattern to television
          programming. The three series listed were You Laugh You Lose, which features PewDiePie watching "a
          stream of supposedly humorous, or perhaps laughable clips" while trying to not laugh; Last Week I Asked You,
          in which he challenges his audience challenges and reviews the output; and Meme Review, in which he reviews
          popular Internet memes.
          PewDiePie also began Pew News, a satirical series that has PewDiePie present and discuss recent news stories
          while in character. Pew News parodies both mainstream news channels, such as CNN, and YouTube news
          channels, such as DramaAlert.
          In May, PewDiePie attracted controversy for using the term "Twitch thots" in one of his videos, at a moment
          when a clip of Twitch streamer Alinity was playing. The controversy was further fueled by Alinity's
          response, in which she asked on stream if she could "copy strike" PewDiePie, referring to tagging PewDiePie's
          video with a copyright violation claim, resulting in a copyright strike for his channel.
          On 5 October, PewDiePie uploaded a diss track against Indian record label T-Series titled "bitch lasagna" in
          response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass his channel in subscribers. On the prospect
          of being surpassed by T-Series in terms of subscriber count, PewDiePie stated, "I don't really care about
          T-Series, but I think if YouTube does shift in a way where it does feel more corporate, then something
          else will take its place."
          Variety noted that many fellow YouTubers, including MrBeast and Markiplier, encouraged their viewers to
          subscribe to PewDiePie. Efforts to keep PewDiePie ahead of T-Series in terms of subscribers also
          included multiple instances of hackers exploiting several thousands of printers to print out messages asking
          people to subscribe to PewDiePie, unsubscribe from T-Series, and upgrade their printer
          security. Bhushan Kumar, the chairman and managing director of T-Series, commented "I am
          really not bothered about this race. I don't even know why PewDiePie is taking this so seriously. He's
          getting his people to push him, promote him. We are not competing with him."
          On 3 December 2018, PewDiePie announced that he had started a fundraiser on GoFundMe for Child Rights and You
          (CRY) in order to help Indian children, partially in response to racist comments left on his videos directed
          toward Indians. PewDiePie also hosted a livestream on 4 December, donating all of its proceeds to
          CRY.
          And, till now, PewDiePie subscriber hit on 79 millions!
